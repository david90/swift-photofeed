#swift-photofeed

In this tutorial, we are going to make a photo feed app, using Skygear as the backend.

Before getting started, here are the prerequisites:

- Xcode 8 or above
- Swift 3
- Cocoapods (You can refer to the [guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html))
- A Skygear account (you can sign up [here](https://portal.skygear.io))



After signing up/logging in to the Skygear portal, you can see the screen below.

To create our photo feed app, just click on the **+ Create New App** box. You will be directed to the app creation page. Name the app **{your_name}photofeed**, in this case I will use the name "vita", so the app name is **vitaphotofeed**.
